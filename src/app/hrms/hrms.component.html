Every institute needs to manage employee documents, personal information, salary details, leave and holiday policies, compensation and benefits and performance appraisal for every employee currently working or previously worked in the institute. For this purpose, we at XIPHIAS have designed an exhaustive human resource information system which can be used by both the employee and employer. The human resource information system stores all important data in a centralized database which can be accessed over the internet. The administrator assigns each user a personal login through which the employee can register and update all required details and documents on the human resource information system which can be accessed over a server across the institution. The main purpose of the human resource information system is to streamline information at one centre and make it accessible to all employees across the institution.</p>

Starting from recruitment of an employee, the institution records all data and stores it either manually or creates innumerable files. Searching or accessing data stored in this format is a tedious task which can be simplified. All employee data from their date of joining to personal details, salary information and yearly performance can be recorded and accessed through the software. The administrator can provide login id to each employee and monitor the records from one location and access all relevant information. It thus streamlines all important information and provides regular updates to the employee and the administration.</p>
