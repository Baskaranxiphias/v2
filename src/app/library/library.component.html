                                    In any school, it's too hard to maintain library since they have students from 1st standard up to the
                                    graduation or post-graduation level, if students wants to take any particular books from library, it's very
                                    hard to search manually. To solve this, <a class="blue-txt" routerLink="/home">A.T.S.I.</a> Library Module has been developed and designed that
                                    allows access to the library wherein the user can view availability of the books and also keep a check on
                                    the stock. The <span class="blue-txt">automated library system</span> has been created with the intention of making libraries more
                                    organized and to make library stocking and accessing more simplified and structured. It uses technology
                                    in terms of RFID tagging, online stock checking, procurement, check-in and check-out, fine management
                                    and the status of a book. It has become an essential tool for large libraries which have a huge number of
                                    books since stock checking and procurement is a lot simpler using the various technological options and
                                    a structured approach.
