It records all transactions when they are procured, sold or are stored in the inventory. For large institutions, keeping manual entries for every item procured or sold is a tedious task, thus the <b class="blue-txt">stock management software</b> helps in automating this process. It can also be used to manage and locate objects or materials. The RFID tagging and cataloguing of the stock helps the stock management software to automatically identify and record the object in the system.</p>

The Store   has been particularly designed to offer updated stock records to the administration department. The primary function of the store inventory management software is to record every item that has been procured, sold or stocked in the inventory and keep an updated track for audit purposes and uses RFID or bar coding to manage and locate the items. It is highly cost effective and gives a real-time picture of the stock. The <b class="blue-txt">stock inventory software</b> also helps in analyzing the stock spent and re-ordering the required products.</p>

                                <p class="text-justify">For efficient utilization of funds, it is important for the institution to track its inventory and demand. This job is done by the stock control software. With the growing number of students, the stock control software helps in bringing more speed and automation to the process. The <b class="blue-txt">Inventory Control Software</b> records all activities starting from procurement of the stock, to sales made and the stock in inventory. Since stock management is directly proportional to accounts and finance, it is essential to use <b class="blue-txt">stock maintenance software</b> that maintains a record of the inventory. The stock control software notifies the user if an item is running low in stock or is unavailable, in the same manner it also alerts the user if a particular item has not moved from inventory at all and can result in high maintenance or costs.</p>
